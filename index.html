			<p>On February 10th 2023 I was able to attend the ATEEZ concert in the Ziggodome in Amsterdam. I had a

				culture in general.</p>

			In the google trends we can see the interest in K-pop peaked in June 2020 and July 2022. In June 2020
			multiple big K-pop groups released new songs and albums, such as TWICE, Jungkook from BTS, Stray Kids,
			SEVENTEEN, and most importantly, Blackpink with their song ‘How you like that’, which broke the record of
			most viewed YouTube music video in 24 hours by a K-pop group.
			In July 2022 interest peaked when artists such as J-Hope from BTS, SEVENTEEN, Aespa, HyunA, Xdinary Heroes,
			ENHYPEN and ATEEZ had comebacks.
			A new group, called NewJeans also debuted with unheard of success. As of now, the group has over 20 million
			monthly listeners on Spotify, almost as much as Blackpink.

			While ATEEZ was the most recent, they surely aren’t the only K-pop group who have held a concert in the
			Ziggo Dome. Late 2022, the worldwide phenomenon Blackpink held a concert in the same hall. The concert was
			fully sold out, with the cheapest tickets being sold at 155 euros a piece. BTS also held a concert in the
			Ziggo Dome back in 2018. In was their first concert in The Netherlands.

			A big difference between The Netherlands and South Korea, is the number of foreigners that are living in the
			country. In The Netherlands in 2022 the number of foreigners living here was 15%, while in South Korea it’s
			only 3.1%! South Korea is also more judgmental towards foreigners and xenophobia is very strong there, so if
			you do go to South Korea be aware!
