		In the google trends we can see the interest in K-pop peaked in June 2020 and July 2022. In June 2020 multiple big K-pop groups released new songs and albums, such as TWICE, Jungkook from BTS, Stray Kids, SEVENTEEN, and most importantly, Blackpink with their song ‘How you like that’, which broke the record of most viewed YouTube music video in 24 hours by a K-pop group. 
		In July 2022 interest peaked when artists such as J-Hope from BTS, SEVENTEEN, Aespa, HyunA, Xdinary Heroes, ENHYPEN and ATEEZ had comebacks.
		A new group, called NewJeans also debuted with unheard of success. As of now, the group has over 20 million monthly listeners on Spotify, almost as much as Blackpink.
